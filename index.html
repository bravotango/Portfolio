      <h3>Where I contribute</h3>
      <p>I am a creative UX / UI Software Engineer. I design and code.</p>
      <p>
        I am a team player who has 20 years of online development experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am a visual person who has passion and experience creating designs and
        collaborating with UX teams. Most recently, I contribute designs using
        Figma and Adobe XD.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love learning and creating within JavaScript frameworks and libraries.
        Most recently, I develop in TypeScript while working in: Angular, React,
        Redux.
      </p>

      <h3>What Interests Me</h3>
      <p>
        I like building creative projects that promote health, are educational,
        or involve sports. I like the challenge of displaying data in a simple
        understandable way. I enjoy design. I like creating art with pencil,
        paint, and computers.
      </p>

      <p>
        My roles have always involved interface responsibilities. I have
        expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My focus when developing
        solutions is simplicity.
      </p>

      <h3>How I Play</h3>
      <p>
        I love to laugh. I love being outside. I love playing soccer or riding
        motorcycles with my 2 wonderful children. I love yard work, I practice
        yoga, and during summers we pull our travel trailer on adventures around
        the Pacific Northwest. Our home is in Bothell, protected by Hazel, our
        husky-shepherd and Boo, our big orange cat.

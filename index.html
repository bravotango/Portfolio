          <h3>I design & code</h3>
          <p>I love learning.</p>
          <p>
            I am a team player with 20 years of online development experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am a visual person who has passion and experience creating designs
            and developing code.
          </p>

          <p>
            I love learning and creating designs with Figma & developing within
            JavaScript frameworks and libraries. Most recently, I develop in
            TypeScript while working in Angular & React.
          </p>

          <h3>What Interests Me</h3>
          <p>
            I like building creative projects that promote health, are
            educational, or involve sports. I like the challenge of displaying
            data in a simple understandable way. I enjoy design. I like creating
            art with pencil, paint, and computers.
          </p>

          <p>
            My roles have always involved interface responsibilities. I have
            expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My focus when developing
            solutions is simplicity.
          </p>

          <h3>How I Play</h3>
          <p>
            I love to laugh. I love being outside. I love playing soccer or
            riding motorcycles with my 2 wonderful children. I love yard work, I
            practice yoga, and during summers we pull our travel trailer on
            adventures around the Pacific Northwest. Our home is in Bothell,
            surrounded by trees and protected by Hazel, our beautiful
            husky-shepherd.
